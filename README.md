## üöÄ Running
Get running MongoDB instance for storing data. Make sure you create collection, name it whatever you want and put it at the end of your MongoDB connection string. You can use [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) for free MongoDB instance. 

Create root collection for application data (e.g. `mindgame`).
